Greetings!

This repo contains files of GEmSysC, an unified cryptographic API for embedded systems which allows embedded software to access cryptographic functions in a consistent way that does not depend on the underlying library. This API, both sample implementations, and the test code were developed as part of my Master's research project, back in 2016. The thesis was published in Portuguese language only, but we also published an article in English language. If you are interested in this project, feel free to contact me!

My thesis (in Portuguese) can be found at: <http://repositorio.utfpr.edu.br/jspui/handle/1/1813>.

The article (in English) can be found at: <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7828302/>.

Best regards.
